        texts: "History Until the mid of the first millennium B.C., the territory of modern Tajikistan in the areas of Amudarya and Sirdarya were settled by Eastern Iranian tribes. Bactria and Sogdiana were the most ancient states, lying along the banks of the upper and middle Amudarya. In the 6th – 4th century B.C. these states were part of the Akhamenids Empire established by Persians. The agricultural area of Sogdiana, that included Fergana and Zerafshan valleys and reaching in the west the area of Bukhara, played an important role in international trade, as it was on trade routes that linked China and Central Asia. The Akhamenid State collapsed in 330 B.C. under pressure from Greek-Macedonian forces. Bactrians, Sogdians and other people of Central Asia were conquered, in spite of their heroic resistance to the army of Alexander the Great. About 200 years later, the population of Bactria and Sogdiana together with massage nomad tribes overthrew the Greek-Macedonian sway. A state was established in Bactria – Tokharistan, which later together with Sogdiana became part of the big Kushan kingdom. The Silk Road crossed via Tokharistan and silk was bought at the markets near the river Tarima and was delivered to the countries of Greek-Roman Empires of the west. In the reverse direction from Rome and Byzantine to China, glass products (such as crystal and thin multi-coloured glassware) were imported, from Central Asia – items such as adornments, gems and from India – paper, woollen fabrics and spices. In the 5th century, Tokharistan, Sogdiana and other areas of Central Asia were under the rule of Ephtalits, and later in the 6th century – nomad Turkic speaking tribes occupied the same region. Sogdians had a great influence on the nomads, who while settling mixed with the local population. During the 6th and 7th centuries in Tokharistan and Sogdiana there were many slaves and at the same time, the formation of a feudal system had already started. As a result, the economy and culture developed quickly. Iron, copper, lazurite, and rubies were extracted at mines, irrigation channels were constructed, and arid places were irrigated. The importance of feudal cities started to grow, as well as craft and trade were developing. The main languages were Bactrian and Sogdian – which are Eastern Iranian languages. Numerous independent principalities emerged with the development of feudal relationships. But they were weak and could not resist the Arabs, who in the 7th &amp; 8th centuries invaded Central Asia.",

You should not expect Western standards of travel and accommodation while travelling in Tajikistan. It is one of the few places in world which is still remaining truly adventurous - and it really is. The civil war of 1992-1997 damaged most of the country's infrastructure such as roads and utilities. The peace is now restored and infrastructure is improving, but it will take another time before western standard would be available.\r\n\r\nWhat Accommodation standards are there in Tajikistan?\r\n\r\nOutside of big cities, the choice of accommodation is a very limited. In cities we stay in hotels with bathroom en rooms while in villages, it will usually be a private guesthouse. Some of them are very good we others very neat and basic. We choose guesthouses with washing facilities whenever possible but however in some remote locations, it might be impossible for a few days. Toilets are usually based outside and are \"long drop\". We are sure you will enjoy time spent in houses of local families and experience genuine hospitality of Tajiki people.\r\n\r\nHow big are your groups?\r\n\r\nWe are trying very much to be as friendly to our environment as possible and therefore we travel in small groups of 1-6 like-minded travelers.

Even safer than many European countries. However your embassy may publish their own view over security situation in the region. A shade is usually dropped by a long civil war in the past and border with Afghanistan which is still unstable economically and politically. We take our responsibility to ensure that you have a safe trip and in case of any warnings will cancel your trip before arrival or change your itinerary to ensure you can finish the trip out of danger.\r\n\r\nHow much does Tajik visa cost?\r\n\r\nThe cost of Tajikistan visa may vary from embassy to embassy and so if you are getting your visa from a Tajik embassy, please contact the embassy for the cost.

To the south of the main range is Lake Iskandarkul - 2.5km in length, 1km wide, and about 72m deep, at an altitude of 2,255m - on the shores of which a hostel with the same name is situated. Apparently, this lake came into existence several thousand years ago as the result of a landslide. The water in the lake is bluish-green, slightly turbid and very cold, so only the bravest dare swim there.\r\n\r\nFrom the north, the Serima River flows into the lake, from the west, the Saritag River (with the largest volume of water), and from the south, Hazor-Mech River. Only one river, Iskandar-Darya, flows out of the lake. It has a waterfall which cannot be seen from the road and one has to come close to it to enjoy its charming beauty. There are almost no fish in the lake because of the concentration of minerals in it. Only small loach (similar to catfish), survive in such water.\r\n\r\nNext to the lake is Chulboi Mountain (3,358m), also known as Dozhdemernaya (Rain Gauge) Mountain. It was called this after a precipitation gauge was set up near the mountaintop. There are good paths leading to the top, which is flat and covered with grass. A panoramic view of Lake Iskandarkul and its vicinity is visible from there.\r\n\r\nIskandarkul's flora is not particularly abundant but it is exceptionally diverse. You will come across the forest, steppe, meadow and high mountain flora (everything from apricot-trees to moss and lichens) there.\r\nNear the lake, one can sometimes see rabbits, foxes, wolves, red marmots, black and brown bears, mountain goats and their companions - palang (snow leopards) and other animals. As for birds, mountain turkeys (snow cocks), stone partridges, griffons, and quails are also found here. Many legends are connected with Iskandarkul. According to one of them, Alexander the Great, during his march to India, reached the lake and camped on its shores.\r\n\r\nAfter a very hard march through the mountains, his favorite horse became sick after drinking water from the lake. He did not wait for it to recover and continued his march, leaving the horse with several soldiers on the lake shore to recover. After a short time the horse recovered, but one day it suddenly behaved strangely and threw itself into the lake and sank to the bottom. Now, during the full moon, it is possible to see a white-maned horse coming out of the lake, which grazes and plays in nearby meadows all night long, then at dawn returns to the lake depths. According to local legend, Alexander's horse went to the bottom of the lake, anticipating the death of its master, who fell ill and died on the way back from India. Unlike Iskandarkul, the Bolshoi (Greater) Allo Lake (3,360m) in the Zindon Valley was formed relatively recently. In 1916 there was a large rockfall from the southern slopes of the main range which blocked the valley.\r\n\r\nThe dam was formed from ancient moraines blocked by this mighty landslide. \"Allo\" in Tajik means \"echo\". On the right and left sides of the lake are sheer cliffs, on the north, scattered giant blocks and on the south is a bottle-neck, where the Levy (Left) Zindon River winds its way over the slippery rocks. It is possible to see rare flowers such as edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum) near the lake. On its left shore, the vegetation ends and further afield a stone desert begins, resting on the cliffs of Moscow Peak (5,183m). The Lake is also near other peaks over 5,000m - Mirali, Chimtarga, and Energiya. To the north, where glaciers once lay, is Lake Kulikalon and its neighbours - Chukurak, Ziyorat, Bibi-Jannat, Dushoha as well as the popular Alauddin lakes (2,700m) with a mountaineer's base.\r\n\r\nLake Kulikalon (big Lake) is situated at an altitude of 2,800m, and is the second largest lake (after Iskandarkul) in this area. The lake actually consists of two lakes: Bolshoi (large) Kulikalon and Maly (smaller) Kulikalon, which are connected by a channel. The northern shore of the lake is indented with large and small creeks separated by capes and crevices. The lake shores are wooded. The water from Maly Kulikalon goes underground and emerges again 600m below as the Urech River. The water at the southern end of Bolshoi Lake is noticeably cooler than at the northern end where it is possible to swim. Its colour also changes near the shores. It looks as if the black bodies of dead animals lie motionless in the bluish-green water. There are marinka (Schizothorax) fish in the lake.\r\nThere is a good trail along the lake's western shore but the eastern shore is difficult to traverse due to rock falls. Over the Bolshoi Lake, there are abandoned fluorite quarries in which it is possible to find beautiful gemstones.\r\n\r\nThe Alauddin Lakes are a group of reservoirs upstream in the Pasrud valley. All the lakes are situated on the steps of ancient and modern moraines. Pure, clear water pours from one step into another and the level of water in the lake remains constant. There are no fish in the lakes. Only the most experienced and adventurous will bathe in the water for any length of time since it is very cold.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to set up a base camp not far from the astonishingly blue Alauddin lake. Along all of its shores, there are juniper forests and the reddish 2km-long Chap-dara Wall overlooks the splendour below and its large rock falls. If you climb the Alauddin Lakes Pass then you will see the lake in all the various shades of blue: from light-blue near the shore to dark-blue in the middle with clear borders separating the various shades.\r\n\r\nHigher up the Chapdara River, there is a beautiful view of the valley with its majestic rocky bulwarks on both sides. The Chapdara Wall faces north-west and hence reflects an astonishing gold colour during sunset.\r\nOn the opposite side of the valley is the Adamtash (Stone Man, 4,940m) massif with vertical bulwarks on its north-west face.  From the mountaineers camp, a route leads along the northern ridge directly to the top. If you climb up from the lakes along the valley then within two hours you will reach the beautiful Mutnye (Muddy) Lakes (3,490m), located in the circle between the slopes of two mountains - on the western side Zamok and on the eastern Chimtarga. The vertical bulwarks of Bodkhona and then Zamok, riding one after another, appear to your left as you cover the two last steep ascents. The north-eastern Chapdara Wall rises from a side valley located a lot lower than the base camp. This is a 1,500m, almost vertical, smooth, rocky cliff-face. It ends with a huge semicircle and opens up the to the whole Fan Mountains region - a wonderful sight for those who have braved the 10- 12 long hours of snaking mountain roads built along the tops of cliffs hundreds of meters deep.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA very pretty view begins at the Kaznok Pass (4,000m) on the incredible south and west cliffs of Chimtarga Peak with a formidable sub-peak bulwark, through which a number of complex rocky routes run in parallel. Mutnye Lakes is a good base camp from which to attempt these cliffs. There is no vegetation in the lakes area; all that exists is rubble.\r\nThe grand northern cliffs of the Adamtash (with a 1,000m cliff-face), Maria and Mirali (with 1,500m cliff-faces) enclose the valley, hanging over the scenic Dush-okha Lake each with its formidable magnificence. There are actually two lakes - the Upper and the Lower with a narrow strip of land between them.\r\n\r\nThe two-hour climb up from Lake Kulikalon will take you to the grand northern cliff of Maria Peak, which has a complex combination of routes and its own cold microclimate with a cliff-face of more than 1,500m.\r\nAlauddin Peak (4,237m), rising to the west of the Alauddin lakes, serves as a good point from which to view the area and can also be used for the first part of the climb from Alauddin Pass (3,730m). It is practical to camp here overnight to acclimatize (it is 2-3 hours walk from the lakes).\r\n\r\nThe Pravy (Right) Zindon Valley, the northern cliff of Zindon Peak (\"Prison Peak\" - 4,800m), encloses the surrounding area, making the scenery gloomy. The 1km vertical cliff with an ice \"ceiling\" at the top can be very intimidating. Climbing becomes hard here since the rocks are always damp - water flowing down leaves black marks on the cliff.\r\n\r\nThe Marguzor Lakes are small reser voirs including Nezhigon, Soya, Gushor, Nofin, Khurdak, Marguzor, and Hazorchashma. They are situated in the south west branches of the Zarafshon range, 2-3 hours drive from Panjakent. The difference in al titude between the upper and lower lakes is 692m. All the lakes, except for Hazorchashma Lake, were formed by the creation of dams.\r\n\r\nMarguzor Lake, the largest lake of the \"Seven Beauties\", is 4.5km in length, 45m in depth, and its water is a fine shade of blue. The lake sits at 2,200m above sea level. Near the lake you can see primitive people's drawings on limestone blocks. There are also the remains of an ancient mine where it is easy to gather rare and unusually-coloured stones. The nortnern slope\"of Marguzor Lake dam is a dense grove of high trees and fragrant herbs, and creeks running through the body of this natural dam.\r\n\r\nLake Nofin stretches for 2km with a width of 400m and has greenish water.\r\nThere are deep caves near the harsh and cold Hazorchashma Lake. In one of them is the Iceland spar, and you can also find rare minerals here such as malachite, rock crystal, and antimonite.\r\n\r\nThe water in Lake Soya is an astonishingly beautiful colour. The water fades through all the shades of blue and sometimes even appears purple. At the bottom of the lake you can see stones through water which change colour according to the position of the sun.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNezhigon Lake is the pearl of the whole Marguzor Lakes chain. It is not very big and is surrounded by cliffs. The turquoise water which fills the deep hollow appears frozen. An overhang from the snow-topped mountain above the lake shines like a halo and is very pleasing to the eye. The water in the lake is warm enough to swim in.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe flora and fauna of the Fan Mountains area is fairly unique. There are more than 2,000 species of plant here, including many medicinal herbs. Up to 2,200m there are many orchards where walnut, poplar, birch, sallow, hawthorn, sea-buckthorn, barberry, dog-rose, and currant bushes grow. Above 3,200m the trees disappear and the mountain slopes are covered by alpine meadows.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe snow leopard (ounce), white-claw bear, mountain goat (teke), argali sheep, wild boar, wolf, fox, rabbit, marmot, ermine (mustela) is just a small sample of this mountain area's wildlife. As for birds, there are mountain geese, snowcocks, partridges, pigeons, eagles, gryphons, hawks, and many others.\r\nSince ancient times, the Fan Mountains' valleys have been populated by highlanders. When you look at some villages on the steep slopes, it appears that the whole mountain is one high-rise building. Flat-roof houses go up the slope step-by-step in such a way that the roof of those living below serves as a courtyard for the people living above.\r\n\r\nVisiting the Fan Mountains will fill you with true delight since within just a few hours you travel from juniper forests and rich vegetation to a zone of glaciers, uplands and perpetual snow.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBesides hiking and mountain-climbing, there is the possibility for this area to develop water tourism (rafting) and biking, paragliding, downhill skiing and other exotic forms of recreation.\r\nThe best time to visit is between the second half of June and October when the weather is usually dry and warm, and the sun shines brightly the whole day. Sometimes, even at the relatively low altitude of the Kulikalon lakes (2,800m) it can suddenly snow, even in midsummer!\r\n\r\nIn November - May there is a high risk of avalanches on mountain slopes and numerous mountain passes become practically inaccessible.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

It was a tall thin building with stairs inside it (or sometimes outside) and small windows to let in daylight.

When the Almovarids ruled North Africa and Spain, they disapproved of minarets, and so people built mosques without minarets in those areas during the 1000s AD. But when the Almohads conquered the Almovarids, they built a lot of minarets to show that they had won.</strong></h5>\r\n",

However it is not a small mountain; its rise above local terrain rivals that of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismoil_Somoni_Peak\">Ismoil Somoni Peak</a> since it is closer to the deep valley of the Muksu River.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Climbing History</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">In 1937 D. Gushchin led an attempt on the peak which reached the lower summit (6,910 m).</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Korzhenevskaya was first climbed in 1953 by a party led by A. Ugarov; the summit team comprised Ugarov, B. Dimitriev, A. Goziev, A. Kovyrkov, L. Krasavin, E. Ryspajev, R. Sielidzanov, and P. Skorobogatov. They approached via the Fortambek Glacier, to the Korzhenevsky glacier, and thence to the north ridge.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Partly since it is required for the Snow Leopard award, Korzhenevskaya has been climbed many times; it is the second most frequented major peak in the Pamirs, after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin_Peak\">Lenin Peak</a>. A base camp on the moraine of the Moskvin Glacier, and helicopter access make this possible. Korzhenevskaya has been climbed from almost every direction, including a first winter ascent in 1987 by Anatoly Nosov; most of these ascents were by Russians. The most common current route on the mountain ascends from the south and attains the summit ridge from the west side.",

It was renamed Communism Peak in 1962. A group from the Tajik-Pamir research expedition climbed the highest peak in the former Soviet Union for the first time from the Bivachny glacier in 1933. E. Abalakov completed the climb on 2 September. Until 1962 Soviet mountaineers were the only ones who had made the ascent to the peak. Englishmen were the first foreigners to climb it. The best way for tourists and mountaineers to get to the peak area is by a 30 – 40 minute helicopter flight from Jirgatol airport. Tourists are transported to the village by vehicle or by air from Dushanbe. The most convenient places for high-altitude expedition bases are in the upper reaches of the Fortambek glacier, where nature has created two places suitable for this purpose.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">These are the Suloev and Moskvin glades, which lead to relatively simple and safe routes to the nearest and highest peaks in the Pamirs – Ismoili Somoni Peak and Korzhenevskaya Peak (7,105m). The Suloev glade is located 4,100m above sea level, in the pocket of the left moraine of the Turamys glacier (source of the Fortambek glacier). A medical and biological expedition of the Tajik SSR’s Academy of Sciences, which studied the problems of the adaptation of living organisms to the alpine conditions, worked on the Suloev glade in 1971 – 1977 and established two permanent houses. Mountain climbers from the “Stormy Petrel” sports society established a reasonably simple way of climbing to the Pamiri glacier snow plateau (a fairly even 12km plateau at a height of 6,000m) and further to Ismoili Somoni Peak along one of the mountain ridges. Since that time it has been known as “Stormy Petrel’s ridge”. In the 1980s, a shorter route to the Pamir glacier snow plateau was established from the Walter glacier along “Borodkin’s ridge”, and the Mountaineers’ center slowly moved to another glade: the Moskvin, where the Alp-Navruz base camp is now located. The camp is situated in a sub-alpine zone 4,200m above sea level, on the eastern terrace at the junction of Walter and Moskvin glaciers (eastern tributaries of the Fortambek glacier), and it is the most convenient starting point for climbing Ismoili Somoni Peak and Korzhenevskaya Peak because of the ease of access to it. The glade near the Moskvin glacier (total area of about 10 hectares) is fairly safe from rock falls or avalanches.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">There is a small spring-water lake on the Moskvin glade, 4 two-bed, shielded, warmed tents where the camp administration is located during the seasonal period, 11 two-bed houses made of wood and aluminum for mountaineers and tourists, a communication centre, a canteen, a shower, a sauna and other facilities. When necessary, tarpaulin tents are set up here. The main source of electric power on the Moskvin glade is a diesel generator. Natural gas provides heat for cooking. Iron tanks with diesel fuel and containers with natural gas are delivered by helicopter from Dushanbe. There is also a convenient helicopter landing-ground here.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">At present there are two ways of delivering people, shipments, and food to Moskvin glade: by helicopter from Dushanbe (flight time – 1.5 hours each way) or a 350km drive to the east of the capital, along the Vakhsh, Surkhob and Muksu rivers as far as Depshar (near Jirgatol), and then a 7-day walk to the final destination – through four mountain passes (Belkandov, Irgay, Tamosha and Kuray Shapak) along the northern ridge of the Peter I range, accompanied by porters specially trained in mountain conditions. At present, the camp functions on the Moskvin glade for only two to three months (July-September). The rest of the time it is not operational due to the difficulty of access and severe climate conditions (freezing temperatures, wind, snow, and altitude).",

It was thought to be the highest point in the Pamirs in Tajikistan until 1933 when Ismoil Somoni Peak was climbed and found to be more than 300 metres higher.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Climbing history and routes</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Initial exploration of this part of Central Asia occurred in the period 1774–82. Arguably the first recorded travel through the region is the involuntary journey of the slave Filipp Efremov (an ethnic Russian), who escaped from slavery in Bukhara. He crossed the Fergana valley, then via Osh, the Chigirik Pass and Terekdavan Pass he reached the Kashgar and finally came over the Karakorum. He was the first European who crossed the Alai Mountains.<sup>[9] [10]</sup></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Scientific expeditions to the Alai Mountains began in 1871 when Alexei Pavlovich Fedchenko discovered the Trans-Alai (Zaalayskiy) Range and its main peak. The first geographical expedition which came nearest to the base of the future Lenin Peak in the early 20th century was arguably the expedition of Nikolai Leopol'dovich Korzhenevskiy.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">In September 1928, three mountaineers -the Germans Eugen Allwein and Karl Wien, and the Austrian Erwin Schneider- from a Soviet-German scientific expedition, made the first attempt to reach the highest point of the Trans-Alai Range, which at that time had the name Kaufman Peak.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">They started climbing upstream of the Saukdara river along the South slope of Trans-Alai Range also Trans-Alay Range. From the river head, they continued climbing along the Greater Saukdara Glacier towards a saddle at an elevation of 5820 m (this saddle is also known as the Krilenko Pass). On September 25, 1928 they started climbing from the saddle along the NE Ridge and at 15.30 they reached the summit. At the time, Kaufman Peak was the highest summit reached by men.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">The title Lenin Peak was first applied to the highest point of the Trans-Alai Range in the same year (1928). When it was renamed after Lenin it was believed to be the highest point in the USSR.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">On September 8, 1934, at 16:20 Kasian Chernuha, Vitaly Abalakov and Ivan Lukin, three members of a Soviet expedition, reached the summit at an elevation of 7,134 metres (23,406 ft). Their attempt lasted for four days with three camps (5700 m, 6500 m, and 7000 m). The expedition started climbing from the Achik-Tash canyon in the Alai valley. The summit attempt itself was started along the Western ice slope of the Lenin glacier. They continued climbing along the North Face, passing the rocks that were later given the name Lipkin's Rocks. At the end of the second day, they reached the crest of the NE ridge at an elevation of about 6500 m. During the following day and a half, they climbed along the NE Ridge and, utterly exhausted, reached the summit.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">The third ascent was three years later, in 1937, when eight Soviet climbers under the direction of Lev Barkhash reached the summit by the same route. This was at the beginning of mass political repressions in the Soviet Union and many of the most prominent Soviet climbers, including Lev Barkhash, were brought to trial.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Subsequent attempts to climb Lenin Peak could not begin until 1950 when the USSR began to recover from the Second World War. On August 14, 1950, twelve climbers (V. Aksenov, K, Zaporojchenko, Y. Izrael, V. Kovalev, A. Kormshikov, Y. Maslov, E. Nagel, V. Narishkin, V. Nikonov, V. Nozdryuhin, I. Rojkov) under the direction of Vladimir Racek reached the summit for the fourth time.</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">All three Soviet expeditions including Racec's expedition of 1950 were by almost the same route via the NE Ridge.<sup>[11]</sup></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">The route which now is known as the classic route, via the Razdelnaya Peak and NW Ridge, was first climbed in 1954 by the team of Soviet climbers under the direction of V. Kovalev (P. Karpov, E. Nagel, V. Narishkin, V. Nozdryuhin).</h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">In 1960, a group of eight Soviet climbers made a successful direct climb along the North Face (15.08.1960).<sup>[8]</sup></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">There are 16 established routes, nine on the southern side and seven on the northern slopes.

In this mountainous region, there was once a small state Shungan consisting of several fortresses scattered around. One of them called Kalai-Panjbar was located at the junction of rivers Gunt and Panj, exactly in the place of present Khorog. First, it was an independent mountain state; later in the 19th century it fell under the rule of the Bukhara Khanate, and in 1986 the territory was occupied by troops of the Russian Empire. During the “Great Game” between Russia and Great Britain, Russians tried to get control of Pamir, and built a road from Osh to Sary-Tash, then to Murghab and finally to Khorog. They organized a frontier post on the banks of river Panj and a small village of Khorog began to develop. At the beginning of the 20th century, with the arrival of the Soviet rule, Khorog became an administrative center of the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomy, and in 1928 received the status of the city. During the 20th century, it was a trading point on the Pamir Highway and still serves as such up to now.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Today Khorog is a real center of Gorno-Badakhshan. There is a trade road from China to Central Asia; it is also an indispensable point for all touristic routes around Pamir.

Pamir botanical garden is located not far from Khorog and opens an excellent panoramic view of the whole city.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Another well-known landmark of Khorog is a local history museum where you can learn a lot about the nature, history, and culture of the Gorno-Badakhshan region. The most interesting exhibit of this museum is a piano that in 1914 had been hand-carried for over a month by soldiers from Osh (Kyrgyzstan). In order to describe the complexity of the delivery, it is enough to say that road from Osh to Khorog is more than 700km with several 4000 m high mountain passes. The delivered piano was for the daughter of the frontier post commandant and the locals would come to listen to the players on this “unusual” instrument.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Today Khorog is the capital of the Gorno-Badakhshan.

The lecture had the wanted impact on top authorities of the army of the Russian Empire and it was decided, under conditions of complete secrecy, to construct a road from Osh to Sary-Tash, on the territory of present Kyrgyzstan.

The piano that took one month to deliver is now exhibited in the Khorog History Museum.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>In 1937, the highway that connects Osh and Khorog was built on the Pamir tract. In 1940, the second and final part of the road, between Khorog and Dushanbe, was launched. During the war in Afghanistan (1979 – 1989), Pamir Highway served as a strategic road; troops were shifted on the areas along the river Panj. However, during the first years of independence and Civil War in 1992-1997, quality of roads on the Pamir Highway began to decrease as no one was reconstructing damaged roads.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Today Pamir Highway is taking up the threads. The road development is promoted by massive cargo from/to China. Apart from that, in the recent years, Pamir has become a more popular destination for off-the-beaten path adventure seekers. Tourism facilities like guests houses, rural infrastructure and roads, are gradually getting bettered responding to rising demand.</strong></h5>",

        texts: "Pamir Highway is a road running for more than 1500 km, starting in Dushanbe and ending in Osh.</strong></h4>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The peculiarity of the road is that it lies on the height from 900 to 4655 meters, and the route goes through picturesque mountainous regions of Pamir. Due to the harsh mountain climate, road conditions in many places are bad. We recommend learning in advance road conditions, altitude fluctuations, duration of the trip and some other details from our experience we found noteworthy before traveling to Pamir. It will help planning your trip program and getting ready for possible inconveniences.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Pamir Highway trip goes via Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region. GBAO permit is required to visit the area. You will be asked to provide its copy at every checkpoint. That’s for it is recommended to print out 10 copies in advance.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Below you will find more information on every section of Pamir Highway that can usually be covered in one day.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Dushanbe – Kalai-Khumb</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Distance from Dushanbe to Kalai-Khumb is 370 km, and the most part of the road is in a very good condition. Only the last 40 km of the road lies via a narrow gorge and a dirt road. The road usually takes 8 hours including stops for lunch and taking photos in beautiful places. The highest point on this part of the Pamir Highway is Shuroabad pass (1959m). Most popular stops for photos are Nurek water reserve and panoramic view over river Panj from Shuroabad pass.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> </strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Kalai-Khumb – Khorog</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The piece of road from Kalai-Khumb to Khorog goes via deep gorge along the river Panj. The road is in a poor condition and thus the distance of 240km is covered in 8 hours. Combination of dirt and old pavement allows driving only for jeeps and cross-country cars. Sometimes the road gets that narrow that you will have to follow a slow car in front or wait on the descent until oncoming traffic will pass by. Some roads are very dusty and all windows need to be closed. The road runs along the river, and that is why all day it will be a smooth drive up to the height from 1300 m to Qalai-Khumb at 2100 min Khorog. Hundreds of picturesque mountain landscapes will pass by as you drive, but since the road is too narrow it is not possible to stop. The only way to take photos is from the car.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Khorog – Ishkashim</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The road Khorog-Ishkashim runs for 110 km; the first half of the road runs across a dirt road, and the second half – on the rather good pavement. Thus it lasts around 3,5-4 hours. As it was in the lot of Qalai-Khumb, there are narrow parts of the road, lying along the river Panj on the ascending altitude of 2100 - 2500 m above sea level. You won’t see noticeable mountain views for photo stops as you drive. In the middle of your way, the road branches out to the local sight Garm-Chashma.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Ishkashim – Langar</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>This section of the Pamir Highway lies across a picturesque Wakhan corridor with several interesting sights and you can enjoy snow-white six-thousand (mountain peaks that are over 6000 meters high). It is only 150 km from Ishkasim to Langar, but taking into consideration stops at all possible interesting places, the road may last up to 8-10 hours. Road conditions are decent: pavement and some dirt road. As you drive, you can see such attractions as Kakh-Kakha and Yamchun fortresses, beautiful villages, and breathtaking panoramic views of Wakhan valley. In addition, there will be no gas stations further on, and it will be possible to get fuel only at mobile stations which is a truck with an oil tank. The climb will reach 300 meters: from 2500 min Ishkasim to 2800 min Langar. Turning from the road to the Yamchun fortress, you will move up to 400 m.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Langar – Murghab</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The distance between Langar and Murghab is 255 km. There, road conditions are poor and it takes around 7-8 hours to reach the destination. The first 100 km of the road lie via a dirt road further continued with a pavement that has many wavy parts causing the speed limit.</strong>\r\n<strong> The elevation on this day will be from 2800 to 3600 m (above sea level). You will drive through two mountain passes – Khargush (4344m) and Naizatash (4137m) and enjoy many interesting landscapes, several lakes and green meadows around Murghab.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Murghab – Karakul – Sary-Tash – Osh</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The final part of the route on Pamir Highway from Murghab to Osh stretches for 410 km. It is the longest and the highest mountain part that includes a drive via three passes; Ak-Baytal is the highest one among them (4655m). The heights resemble the sinusoid with several ascent and descents: Murghab (3600m), Ak-Baytal pass (4655m), Lake Karakul (3900m), Kyzyl-Art pass (4280m), Sary-Tash (3200m), Toldyk pass (3615m), Osh (1200m).</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>In general, road conditions are rather decent: 90% is pavement, and only passes have some parts of dirt road for better grip of the car on long lifts and descents. The road may take up to 10-12 hours; the duration also depends on how long it takes to cross Tajik-Kyrgyz border of Kyzyl-Art. It is possible to make a stop at the Ak-Baytal pass that is one of the highest automobile mountain passes in the world and enjoy the breathtaking view of the Karakul Lake, and then, on the Kyrgyz side, see the Lenin’s Peak (7134m) in Sary Tash.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>For those planning to travel solo to Pamir Highway, we recommend to consider fuel reserves in advance and take all necessary tools as there will be very few gas stations and garages on the road, and it may last hours to wait for the help of other drivers, as traffic on the highway is rare.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>For those taking a group tour to Pamir Highway, it is to know that there will be a long hour drive for the whole week on bad roads with constant jolting and other inconveniences. However, still in return, you will see beautiful landscapes as you drive and have an opportunity to get to know the unique culture of this region on the edge of the world.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> </strong></h5>",

        title: "Pamir Highway Accommodation",
        texts: "Traveling across Pamir Highway is a long trip in the mountainous regions of Tajikistan, where due to remoteness from large cities, living conditions are deprived of some blessings of civilization.</strong></h3>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>It is better to learn living conditions and what to expect before taking a trip to Pamir Highway that will take a week or more. Pamir Highway tour usually begins in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, where you can find a hotel of any level including luxurious five-star hotels. However, it gets worse, the further you travel from Dushanbe. In paragraphs below, we have attempted to describe accommodation in every city and settlement on the Pamir Highway, where most stops are done (in 2017).</strong></h5>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Accommodation in Kalai-Khumb</strong></h2>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Kalai-Khumb is a small settlement along the river Panj, where most people traveling to Pamir Highway stop for overnight. Earlier, there was an option of only a few guesthouses, traditional Tajik houses, where tourists could share a room. However, in 2015, Karon Palace hotel was opened with comfort level as great as in 4-, 5- star hotels in Dushanbe. This hotel offers everything necessary for a good stay and Wi-Fi available throughout the hotel. It is possible to book a room online whereas, in the guesthouses in Kalai-Khumb, you need to make a deal on the place.</strong></h5>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Accommodation in Khorog</strong></h2>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Khorog is the only city in Pamir and the capital of Gorno-Badakhshan. You can find there cozy 2-star hotels, rather decent hostels, and guesthouses. In general, conditions are not that comfortable but at least they have everything necessary for rest after a long drive from Qalai-Khumb to Khorog. There are also restaurants, shops and other infrastructure in the city. The major disadvantage is a slow internet sufficient only to check emails and messengers. One of the best options for accommodation in Khorog is The Lal Hotel.</strong></h5>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Accommodation in Ishkashim</strong></h2>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Ishkashim is the southernmost settlement on Pamir Highway located at the beginning of the picturesque Wakhan corridor. This small village has few guesthouses and a small hotel Anis. Guesthouses are like all others on the route of Pamir Highway. Hotel Anis has several double rooms with two single beds and a table. Bathrooms are shared, sometimes creating queues. There is a lawn where you can set up a tent. To sum up, accommodation reminds communal living. There is no internet, so the only alternative is to spend an evening communicating with other travelers; dozens of tourists flock there during the high season.</strong></h5>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Accommodation in Langar</strong></h2>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Langar is a genuine Pamir village where you can see and feel life away from big cities. There are several private guesthouses in traditional Pamir style. They are all the same: big and nice living room, where they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, and small bedrooms. Shared bathrooms are quite nice, but it is to take into consideration that there may be queues during the high time. Although you will not find there all blessings of civilization; harmony, fresh air, and tranquility might make you want to take some time off there.</strong></h5>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Accommodation in Murghab</strong></h2>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Murghab is a settlement on the height of 3600 meters, where you can feel rather dizzy. There is only one hotel Pamir in Murghab and several modest guesthouses. Tourists mainly prefer to stay in the hotel Pamir. Staying in the hotel is as harsh as the local nature. Hot water and electricity are available only during periods of 7.00-12.00 and in the evening between 19.00-00.00. Living conditions are Spartan, but you won’t find anything better. Rooms are equipped with single beds, tables, and sanitary utensils. Wi-Fi is not available, but mobile communication works and you can use mobile internet.</strong></h5>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Accommodation in Karakul</strong></h2>\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Karakul is a settlement on the height of 3900meters at the shore of the lake. There are two guesthouses with very scarce living conditions: no water for hygiene, outdoor WC, electricity available only between 19.00 and 23.00 and others. The only advantage is an opportunity to experience a night staying at a great height, and see the life of local people on this rough land. As described above, trips and overnights on Pamir Highway are missing the basic comfort as you go further Khorog. Travelers are usually aware of it in advance and set realistic expectations. There will be no internet, TV and other connection with the rest of the world on the route after Khorog. You will spend evenings with locals and other travelers. We recommend you taking a book, some music to listen, or some board games with yourself to enjoy long evenings.",

Fluctuation of temperatures is a usual thing for desserts and in Karakul Lake, they are just incredible. The great Russian Explorer of Pamirs N. Korjenevskiy, describing lake Karakul wrote: \"In February, at 9 am the temperature was -35 Centigrade, while at 1 pm the temperature raised up to -6,2 Centigrade and so fluctuation of temperature for 4 hours was 28.8 Centigrade\".</strong></h5>\r\n<h5><strong>The temperature measurement is taken between 1933 and 1934 shows there were only 15 frost-free days a year and by latest measurements taken in our days, it is known that 67 of 100 years had no frost-free periods at all.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5><strong>Karakul is Kyrgyz for \"black lake\" and it indeed looks black when the sun is hidden by clouds.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5><strong>Karakul has an area of 380 sq km and lies at the altitude of 3914 </strong>metres<strong> above sea level. It's the highest lake in the world excluding those in Tibet and even Titicaca lake - the biggest alpine lake in the world is located at lower altitudes.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5><strong>The lake has 2 basins separated by a peninsula from the south and an island in the north. The island is 8 km long and 4 km wide. The strait between them is 1 km wide. Eastside is 22,5 </strong>metres<strong> deep, while west basin deepest point is 236 m. There are 3 rivers flow in but these days the lake has no outflow and therefore the water is very salty.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5><strong>The salt mineralization is constantly increases and 1 liter of boiled out water would leave 7 grams of salt which makes the water undrinkable and useless for watering. </strong>Sulphate<strong> salt makes water taste brackish.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5><strong>Karakul's water level is now much lower than before, but this fact also applies to many other closed lakes of Inner Asia. N. Korjenevskiy noted that before Karakul lake was at least 60 </strong>metres<strong> above the present level. But even 37 </strong>metres<strong> is enough to create an outflow to the south where the valley ends up with the flat pass towards Kokuibel valley. This means the lake was much bigger in the past and had an outflow that feeds Pyanj and finally Amudaria River known in the west as Oxus. </strong>Its<strong> not exactly known when the lake had an outflow, should be an ice age when glaciers were at much lower altitudes and some of them flow down the lake. Later the lake's territory reduced, the depths diminished, the lake lost its outflow and finally became salty.</strong></h5>\r\n<h5><strong>The Karakul lake impact structure remained unidentified until the recent geological research undertaken by Russian scientists along with studies of imagery taken from space which let some scholars diagnose Karakul Lake depression as meteorite impact crater with a rim diameter of 52 kilometers and created some 230-190 mln years ago.</strong></h5>",
